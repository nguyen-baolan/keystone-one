## Why this mattered

In high-stakes environments, “AI assistance” fails when outputs are not explainable, reviewable, or accountable.

The goal was not to generate more content—it was to reduce decision friction while increasing confidence and auditability.

## Approach

We designed a workflow where analysis is broken into explicit steps, with clear handoffs and evidence capture:

1. **Decompose the decision** into required questions (thesis, risks, constraints, alternatives)
2. **Gather and structure evidence** from approved sources
3. **Run specialized analysis passes** (e.g., risk review, assumption checking)
4. **Produce an investment-grade memo** with citations and a clear decision recommendation
5. **Embed review gates** so humans remain accountable

## What changed

Instead of a pilot that produced interesting outputs, the team gained a repeatable workflow that could be governed, improved, and reliably adopted.

This is the difference between experimentation and production.
