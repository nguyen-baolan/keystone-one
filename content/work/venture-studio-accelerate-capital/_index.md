## Situation

The leadership team had invested in AI pilots, but the work wasn’t translating into faster or more confident capital allocation. Decisions were still slow, inconsistent, and hard to audit.

## What we did

We partnered directly with executives and the investment team to:

- Assess readiness (data, governance, decision ownership, risk constraints)
- Define a small set of high-value decision workflows worth embedding AI into
- Design an operating model that made outputs reviewable, traceable, and adopted
- Build and deploy a production-grade workflow that fit existing tooling and processes

## Outcome

The result was a decision system designed for real operating needs—clear inputs and outputs, explicit review gates, and a path to sustained use.

If you’re under pressure to show ROI from AI investments, this is what “beyond pilots” looks like.
