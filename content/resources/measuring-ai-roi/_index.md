## 4 steps to estimating the ROI of AI in your organization

### Step #1: first things first: identify where AI adds value in your internal value chain 

What are all the steps from end-to-end to ship the product/service to the customer, and where should AI sit, if at all?

Answering that question is actually quite hard, because it requires having a birds-eye view of the company internal value chain. 

Yet, that is where prioritization must start. "Cutting cost" and "Being more efficient" are not  AI strategies. Using AI at the right operational levers to drive revenue, EBITDA margins or both is a better direction.

Fortunately, many orgs have tried and failed to get value from AI, so everyone can learn from them. According to a study conducted by MIT in 2025: 
- Most execs initially focused on putting AI in sales and marketing. Results have failed to materialize so far 
- Paradoxically, most of the financial results were driven by putting AI in charge of boring back-office processes
- Companies who partnered with experienced vendors in AI were twice as much likely to get  results relative to the ones who went the DIY route (the reason will become obvious as you read on)


Statistically, the TL;DR seems to be: don't try to be fancy with AI. Pick

### Step #2: understanding what AI is actually best suited for

AI is often sold as a magic thing. We see these "hook and bait" headlines on LinkedIn every day: "This template automates 33 SDRs and got me 10,000 qualified leads in 1 hour - comment AGENT to get it for free!"

Of course, it didn't replace 33 SDRs, let alone get 10,000 qualified leads. 

So what can AI realistically do? 

The answer is nuanced, but here are 5 big categories of "tasks best suited for AI" that our clients found helfpul. We deliberately stick to "unsexy" categories, because we believe that's where most of the value is actually created. 


Categories of tasks best suited for AI:
1. Pattern recognition & reasoning tasks: any tasks requiring reading, analyzing, debating, thinking, synthesizing and producing a final written output can be done by AI faster, cheaper and with as-high (or even higher) accuracy than humans. Market research and analysis falls under this category
2. Browser tasks: most (but not all) tasks that a human performs through browsing the web and clicking their way through can be automated cheaply and at scale by AI (think of comparing lots of competitors' pricing every month for example)
3. Mapping tasks: any tasks required expert mapping to translate some meaning or codification into another can be done  by AI faster, cheaper and with as-high (or even higher) accuracy than humans (think of letter of credit code mapping, codification of international vs internal codes in import/export, etc)
4. Generative content: any tasks required to create media content from scratch (text, audio, image, video) can be done by AI faster than humans. Quality varies dramatically however, so treat this category carefully. Replacement of call centers falls into this category
5. Virtual buddy: any time you need an expert advice on something, you normally find a human expert to ask. Now, we can make AI-based experts who know enough to give you the insight you need instantly. While it can't know 100% of the things that a human expert would know, it probably knows 90%, and that is often enough. A very helpful use case is having a virtual board for your company.

There are others, but we found that htese 5 pretty much cover what most companies need. 

In fact, we can't think of a single company that doesn't have at least 3 use cases from the above list.

The challenge is to help leaders form a view of what these "AI tasks" can do for the busines, hence the first point on understanding what drives EBITDA in the first place.

Once that's made clear, the next question is: how do we make sure any AI initiative gets adopted at the operational level?

### Step #3: estimate the cost of the inevitable organizational change

For AI to be adopted, the roles impacted will have to change either in scope, responsibility, or both. Period. 

That obviously has a cost, and helping clients calculating it is a bit tricky. Here is why.

Time saved does not translate into cost savings. It only happens when an entire role disappears.

At the same time, partial replacement is not free. It usually requires reskilling, redefining responsibilities, and changing how work flows between teams. These changes introduce organizational resistance, management overhead, and uncertainty that are difficult to quantify upfront. 

This creates a paradox: executives know where AI can create new value, but what operational teams see is a threat to their job. The reality is a bit more nuanced: some jobs do go away, but most jobs change in scope. Whether or not people want that new scope is a different story - and a risk to model out for CFOs.

To model this properly, we sit with clients to have this straightforward conversation: assuming the AI roadmap is implemented, we give them a list of the roles we think should change and how, as well as a list of the roles that are going to be redundant. 

We found that it's important to call out the elephant in the room earlier rather than later, because it helps everyone iron out the organizational resistance that naturally comes with change. Managers prepare their plans, communication, make a case for reskilling budget, and start have productive conversations with their teams (as opposed to dropping an "AI initiative" on their lapse and cross fingers)

Pass that stage, a last thing needs to be done for the CFO. 

How much does the AI solution really cost, now and into the foreseeable future?

### Step #4: estimate the added CAPEX, infra and token costs of AI

Buying off-the-shelf tools appears simple. Subscription fees and usage-based pricing are visible and easy to explain. Many organizations start here, and often discover that generic tools do not fit critical workflows or decision standards. When those tools fail to deliver, the conversation shifts to building, which is when we're typically brought in.

Build costs are harder to estimate because they do not resemble traditional software projects. They include design of decision logic, orchestration across models and data sources, evaluation and safeguards, and ongoing iteration as real-world usage exposes weaknesses. These costs are front-loaded, uneven, and sensitive to scope creep.

In addition, build cost is only part of the picture. Operating costs such as model usage, compute, monitoring, and support appear gradually and scale with volume. Transition costs, including workflow redesign and temporary productivity loss, sit outside most technology budgets altogether.

Without a clear breakdown of these components, AI cost discussions oscillate between underestimation and sticker shock. That volatility makes ROI calculations fragile and easy to challenge, especially in front of the CFO.

## The ROI of AI: putting it together

AI ROI estimations are hard, but don't despair. Using the 4 simple steps above will give you a solid understanding of the basic cost VS gains. 

To go further, like many organizations have already learned, we suggest bringing in an external partner to help you with your AI ambitions.

At a minimum, they should:
1. Have strong business acumen and be able to speak the CxO language
2. Know how to build AI solutions themselves - non-technical consultants won't be able to tell you the real CAPEX and OPEX cost of the AI solution
3. Enjoy working with operations - to overcome initial resistance, provide hands-on training, educate on AI opportunities, etc.
4. Have led digital transformations in the past -  to get executive involved in the right way, at the right time, structure the appropriate quick-wins to build momentum, etc.

If they have some degree of knowledge or interest about your industry, it is even better. Since every company is different, every AI solution needs to be built around your needs, not some "industry best practice". 

The latter is a nice-to-have (using AI-experts, we do deep dives in industries we do not know inside-out for example), while the former are absolute must-haves. 

The other option is to defy the odds and try to DIY, or give a "this is what I want AI to do" type of requirement to an AI outsourcing vendor. There are way too many inter-related topics in an AI transformation and we definitely do not recommend that path. 

**If you're thinking of implementing an AI solution in the next 3-6 months but don't know where to start, we can help you get started.**
