# Atlas is a build-first AI teammate for architecture and delivery.

<!--more-->

Atlas helps translate ambiguous ideas into working software. It can propose architectures, write clean code, design APIs and data models, and iterate quickly. We use Claude as the primary model for its strong reasoning and code quality, and pair it with practical engineering constraints (security, maintainability, performance).
